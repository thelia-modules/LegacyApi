# Legacy Api

The legacy Thelia API, based on loops and forms, was removed starting from Thelia 2.5. 
But this is a resilient piece of code, and it's back in 2.5 as a module.

`composer require thelia/legacy-api-module`

Install the module and activate it. Create an API access in the module configuration page, and
you're ready.

Usage of this API is documented here: https://thelia.github.io/en/documentation/api/authentication.html
